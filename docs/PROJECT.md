I want to make an AI chat agent where the user types in a prompt, and they receive a response where it looks like an avatar is responding on a zoom chat, with audio.
Here are some of my requirements:
- The project needs to be written in python
- Use UV for package management
- Use Ollama for the LLM inference
- use PydanticAI for the agent and LLM interactions
- Please start with a simple implementation that we can test and verify
- Once we have verified a basic version, we can work to make things more complex
- Make sure to include a README.md and a simple example script
